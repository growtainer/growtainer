🛠️ DIY Growtainer: Two-Bucket Self-Watering Planter
Simple. Affordable. Open-Source.

This guide shows you how to build a self-watering, nutrient-optimized planter using food-grade buckets — perfect for balconies, patios, or water-scarce regions.

⚠️ Important Note: Modern food-grade buckets are designed to stack tightly, leaving insufficient space for a water reservoir when one bucket sits inside another of the same diameter.

This guide includes proven workarounds so your system actually works.

⏱️ Time: 30–60 minutes
💰 Cost: ~€5–15 (can be lower with recycled materials)
🔧 Skills: Beginner-friendly

🧰 Materials & Tools
You’ll Need:
2 food-grade plastic buckets (10–20L)
✅ Option 1: Outer bucket larger than inner (e.g., 20L outer, 16L inner) — ideal but rare
❌ Avoid two buckets of identical size unless you add a support system
Support for inner bucket (choose one):
3–5 cm plastic lid or ring from a third bucket
3D-printed substrate grid (Rost) (e.g., Thingiverse #3984315 )
Commercial self-watering insert (e.g., Tymar WR-Ø30 )
1 plastic cup (50–100ml, rigid — e.g., yogurt cup) for wicking access
Drill or soldering tool (for making holes)
Marker pen
Sandpaper (optional, to smooth edges)
Scissors or utility knife
Cord or zip tie (for securing the surface cover)
For the Substrate:
8–10L coconut coir or peat-free potting mix
100g volcanic rock dust (Urgesteinsmehl)

200g worm castings (Wurmhumus)
50g ground dolomite (Dolomit)
💡 All materials can be sourced locally or repurposed. 

🔧 Step-by-Step Build
Step 1: Solve the Bucket Stacking Problem
Because modern buckets fit too tightly, you must elevate the inner bucket to create a functional water reservoir (5–8 cm high).

Choose one of these methods:

✅ Option A: Use Buckets of Different Sizes
Outer: 20L
Inner: 16L (or smaller)
→ Natural gap for water reservoir
→ Simplest solution if you can find mismatched buckets
✅ Option B: Add a Support System
If both buckets are the same size, create a support ring to hold the inner bucket higher:

From a bucket lid: Cut the outer rim of a third bucket lid to create a 3–5 cm tall ring
3D-printed rost: Use a design like Thingiverse #3984315
Commercial insert: Use a product like the Tymar WR-Ø30
Install the support inside the outer bucket before placing the inner bucket on top.

Step 2: Prepare the Inner Bucket (It Becomes the "Rost")
This bucket holds the soil and acts as a substrate holder and aeration grid.

Mark the height:
Fill the outer bucket with water up to ~5 cm from the top.
Place the inner bucket (on its support) inside and mark the water level on its side.
Cut off the bottom:
Below the water line mark, cut off the entire bottom of the inner bucket.
Drill drainage holes:
Drill 10–15 small holes (3–5mm) in the lower 5 cm of the inner bucket’s walls.
→ Allows roots to reach water while keeping soil in place.
Step 3: Create the Wicking Cup (Capillary Access)
This cup allows roots to draw water without flooding the soil.

Prepare the cup:
Use a rigid plastic cup (e.g., single-serve yogurt container).
Remove or puncture the lid.
Attach to the outer bucket:
Mark a spot on the outer bucket’s side, just below the water line.
Cut a hole slightly smaller than the cup’s diameter.
Push the cup into the hole from the inside, so it sticks into the reservoir.
Seal edges with silicone or tape if needed (optional).
✅ The cup becomes a wicking port — roots grow into it to drink. 

Step 4: Assemble the System
Place the support ring in the bottom of the outer bucket.
Insert the inner bucket (bottomless) onto the support.
Add dolomite layer (recommended):
Pour 1–2 cm of ground dolomite at the bottom of the inner bucket.
→ Prevents Ca/Mg deficiency and stabilizes pH.
Add active substrate:
Mix potting soil with volcanic rock dust and worm castings.
Fill the inner bucket, leaving 3–5 cm at the top.
Step 5: Install the Surface Cover (Abdeckfolie)
This reduces evaporation, blocks weeds, and regulates temperature.

Place the foil over the top of the inner bucket.
Secure it with a cord or zip tie around the rim.
→ Keeps it tight and prevents shifting.
Cut an X-shaped opening where you’ll plant.
Make the X about 5–8 cm across
Lift the flaps and insert your seedling
Press foil back around the stem
✅ This method is simple, effective, and reusable. 

Step 6: Plant & Water
Plant your seedling through the X-cut in the foil.
Fill the reservoir (outer bucket) with water until it reaches just below the bottom of the inner bucket.
Refill every 1–2 weeks, depending on climate and plant size.
🌱 The plant draws water and nutrients as needed — no daily watering!
