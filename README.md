# 🌱 Project Growtainer – The Open-Source Planting System  
**Self-Irrigating. Self Fertilizing. Nutrient-Dense. Sustainable.**

> *A journey to make healthy food accessible to everyone — no matter their space, water, or experience.*

Growtainer is a **biologically intelligent micro-farming system** that makes it easy to grow **fresh, nutrient-rich food** — anywhere.  
Using **self-watering and self-fertilizing principles**, it combines simple physics with advanced soil science to create low-maintenance, high-yield planters for urban balconies, water-scarce regions, schools, and communities.

All designs, science, and guides are **100% free and open-source** — because healthy food should be a shared resource, not a locked-down product.

## 🌍 Vision

A world where every person can grow fresh, nutrient-rich food with minimal water, space, and effort — using intelligent, self-sustaining systems that work with nature.

---

## 🔬 What Makes Growtainer Different?

Most self-watering planters only solve **watering**.  
Growtainer solves **nutrition**.

We go beyond convenience by engineering the **soil ecosystem** for **human health**:
- ✅ **Volcanic rock dust** (Urgesteinsmehl) for trace minerals (Zn, Se, Mn)
- ✅ **Worm castings** for living soil biology and plant hormones
- ✅ **Dolomite layer** for calcium/magnesium and pH stability
- ✅ **Self-dosing nutrients** — the plant takes only what it needs

This isn’t just gardening.  
It’s **nutritional restoration**.
